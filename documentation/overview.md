# Octavia Overview

Octavia is a **cloud-native web platform** designed to break language barriers by translating full videos into new languages with perfectly synced dubbed audio. It automates every technical step—speech recognition, translation, text-to-speech, timing adjustment, and final merging—so users only need to upload a file and choose a target language. The system preserves the exact duration of the original video, ensuring natural pacing without awkward speedups or slowdowns. 

Powered by a **serverless GPU fleet** and advanced AI models (WhisperX, XTTS v2, Demucs), Octavia delivers "Magic Mode" results: fully diarized multi-speaker voice cloning, background music preservation via intelligent ducking, and lip-sync ready outputs. Its clean, modern web interface (Next.js) keeps the experience simple: upload, process, review. Octavia supports long videos—up to 10 hours—using parallel cloud processing to keep results accurate and efficient. The platform includes optional previews, refine tools, and exportable transcripts for creators and educators. Overall, Octavia aims to make high-quality video translation accessible to anyone, anywhere, directly from their browser.
